        "bot_response": "I'm so sorry to hear you're going through this. It's completely understandable that you want to heal and move forward.  Workplace harassment is a serious issue, and it's important to take care of yourself.  \n\nHere are some tips that might help you on the path to healing:\n\n**Prioritize Self-Care:**\n\n* **Reach Out for Support:**  Talking to someone you trust - a friend, family member, therapist, or even a support group - can be incredibly helpful. It's important to have someone to listen and validate your experience.\n* **Mindfulness and Relaxation:** Practice mindfulness techniques like meditation, deep breathing, or yoga to help manage stress and anxiety. These practices can help you regain a sense of control and calmness. \n* **Physical Activity:** Exercise can be a great way to release tension and improve your mood. Even a short walk can make a difference.\n* **Healthy Eating and Sleep:**  Make sure you're getting enough sleep and eating nutritious meals. These are crucial for both your physical and emotional well-being. \n\n**Taking Action (If You Feel Ready):**\n\n* **Document Everything:** Keep a detailed record of the harassment, including dates, times, locations, and specific details.  This can be helpful if you decide to take further action.\n* **Report to Your HR:** Under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, your employer is obligated to take action against harassment. Reporting the incident to your HR department is an important step in addressing the situation. \n* **Consider Legal Action:**  If the harassment is severe or persists, you may want to consider legal options.  A lawyer can advise you on your rights and the best course of action.\n\n**Remember:**\n\n* **You Are Not Alone:** Many people experience workplace harassment.  It's not your fault, and you deserve to feel safe and respected at work.\n* **It's Okay to Take Time:** Healing from harassment takes time. Be patient with yourself and allow yourself to process your emotions. \n* **You Are Strong:** You've shown incredible strength by acknowledging what happened and seeking help. Keep that strength in mind as you move forward.\n\nI'm here to listen if you want to talk more, or if you need help finding resources. Do any of these tips resonate with you? \n"

        "user_message": "my friend mithila left me and had her lunch what do i do now",
        "bot_response": "Oh no, that's definitely frustrating! It sounds like you're feeling a little hurt and maybe even a bit confused.  It's completely normal to feel that way when a friend does something unexpected. \n\nIt's really hard to say what to do without knowing more.  Was it just this once? Or has Mithila been acting differently lately? Is there a possibility you're misinterpreting something?  \n\nBefore you decide what to do, let's explore a few possibilities:\n\n* **Maybe there's a simple explanation:**  Did Mithila say anything about why she left?  Perhaps she had a sudden urgent call or something else came up. Maybe she was feeling ill and didn't want to spread anything.  It's possible she didn't mean to hurt your feelings.\n* **Could there be a communication gap?**  Sometimes miscommunication can lead to misunderstandings.  It's possible Mithila didn't realize how her actions would affect you.\n* **Is there something bigger going on?** If this isn't a one-time occurrence, and you feel Mithila is pulling away, maybe there's a bigger issue.  It might be helpful to talk to her directly to understand her perspective.\n\n**What can you do?**\n\n1. **Take a deep breath:**  Before jumping to conclusions, try to calm down and reflect on the situation.  \n2. **Consider talking to Mithila:**  You could try saying something like, \"Hey Mithila, I noticed you left without saying anything.  Is everything okay?\" \n3. **Give her a chance to explain:**  Listen to what she has to say without judgment.\n4. **Communicate your feelings:** If you feel hurt, it's okay to express that.  \n5. **Don't jump to conclusions:**  It's important to hear her side of the story before making any assumptions. \n\nRemember, friendships are about communication.  Sometimes the best solution is just talking things through. \n\nHow are you feeling about all of this? Do you want to talk about it more? \n\n\n"

What are your goals or plans for Mithila?\n\nThe more information you give me, the better I can understand your situation and give you helpful advice. \n"

It's awesome to have a friend who pushes you to be your best.  \n\nSince you consider yourself the first smartest person, you already have an incredible foundation. Instead of trying to *be like* Daniel, focus on what makes you unique and how you can grow your own strengths.  \n\nHere are some ideas:\n\n* **Identify your strengths:** What are you really good at?  What do you enjoy learning?\n* **Embrace your individuality:**  What sets you apart from Daniel? What unique skills and perspectives do you bring to the table? \n* **Learn from each other:**  Instead of trying to be exactly like Daniel, use his strengths as inspiration. Ask him how he approaches things, what he finds challenging, and how he stays motivated. \n* **Focus on personal growth:**  Don't just focus on being \"smart.\"  Work on your emotional intelligence, communication skills, and how you interact with the world.\n\nRemember, being the \"smartest\" isn't a competition.  It's about continuous learning and growth. Focus on developing yourself and your strengths, and you'll achieve amazing things!  \n"
